距离第一次提交已经过去了两年，两年后的今天自己的学习内容和笔记方式也发生了很大的变化，因此将此repo归档，之后不会再有更新和commits了。

## :exclamation: Attention
+ Latex grammar is not supported in GitHub markdown preview, so you are strongly recommended to
  + download this repo and use VSCode to check these files, or
  + use Chrome and install the extension [MathJax Plugin for Github](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima/related).(Still, this can only solve part of the problem...)
    + You can directly install the extension on Windows and MacOS. For Linux users, this [issue page](https://github.com/orsharir/github-mathjax/issues/24) may provide some help.
